# NEATer Overview

NEATer is a framework for neuroevolution algorithms to evolve Neural Networks. 
At the moment, the only the NEAT algorithm is implemented.
For the future the implementation of more neuroevolution algorithms is planned.

NEATer is developed to be fully compatible with `OpenAI Gyms`. 
Evolving a Neural Network to solve a gym is possible just a few lines of code.

After training, models can be exported to `tensorflow keras` - allowing the use of the networks in  a production environment.
